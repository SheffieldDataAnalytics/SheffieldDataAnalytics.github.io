    <h1 class='main-title'> Introduction to Python </h1>

    <p>This site gives details on how to access the Introduction to Python material
      that has been designed for students planning to study the University of Sheffield's Data
       Analytics MSc.
      The material is designed for you to work through in your own time before
      you start with us in Sheffield.
    </p>

    <p>The material is divided into two parts:
    <ul>
      <li>Part 1 (Introduction to Python) covers the Python programming language and introductory programming concepts. 
      <li>Part 2 (Python for Data Analytics) covers more advanced material about the numpy package for scientific computing.
      </ul>
      </p>
    </p>
    You should attempt to complete all of the exercises in Part 1. 
    We also advise that you attempt the exercises in Part 2, they provide information that will be very useful for your course, but they may prove to be too complicated at this stage. 
    If that's the case then you can revisit them later.
  </p>


    
    <h2>Jupyter Notebooks</h2>

    <p>
      The course materials are delivered as
      <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a> which is a literate
      computing platform that is widely used in data science. The
      Jupyter Notebooks are available on a GitHub repository (<a
      href="https://github.com/SheffieldDataAnalytics/Python-for-Data-Analytics">https://github.com/SheffieldDataAnalytics/Python-for-Data-Analytics</a>)
      but cannot be run there directly. We
      recommend that you run them on a cloud-based
      environment so that only a standard web
      browser is required and you do not have to install any
      software on your own computer. Instructions for one such service (Notebooks_) are
      provided. Alternative services are also available (see below).

    </p>


    <b>To access the material via Notebooks_:</b>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create an account on <a
	href="https://notebooks.ai/">Notebooks_</a> and make sure you
      are logged in.
	<li>Click the "Create New Project" link on the Dashboard page.</li>
	<li>Fill out the following information:
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Name:</b> "Introduction to Python" (or another suitable name for your project)
	  
	  <li>(optional) <b>Description:</b> (add a short description
	  of your project)
	  <li>(optional) <b>Privacy</b> ("Private" or "Unlisted" would
	  be appropriate)
	  <li><b>Copy files from existing repository:</b>
      https://github.com/SheffieldDataAnalytics/Python-for-Data-Analytics
	  (you must copy this exactly!)
	</ul>
	<img src="create_new_project.png" width="500"></img>
	<li>Click the "Create Project" link at the bottom of the
      page. You should now be taken back to the Dashboard page.
	<li>Click "START" on the project you have just created and the
	  "Exercises" to the left of the screen to see a list of
	Jupyter Notebooks.
	<img src="file_list.png" width="500"></img>
	<li>Clicking on one of the notebook files in the list will
	  start a notebook
	server and allow you to work through the material</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

      <b>Alternative ways of accessing the material:</b>
<br>
<p>You may prefer to use one of the following alternative cloud-based methods to
      run the material: </p>
      <p>
      <ul>
	<li><a href="https://cocalc.com">CoCalc</a> provides a similar
	interface to Notebooks_ and offers a free plan.
	<li><a href="https://colab.research.google.com">Google
      Colab</a> allows Jupyter notebooks to be run via Google Drive
      but does not provide a simple interface for copy over all the
      required files. A Google account is required for access.
	</ul>
